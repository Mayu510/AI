1.	Implement depth first search algorithm and Breadth First Search algorithm. Use an undirected graph and develop a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.
from collections import deque
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    visited.add(node)
    print(node, end=" ")
    for neighbour in graph[node]:
        if neighbour not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbour, visited)
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node, end=" ")
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            if neighbour not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbour)
                queue.append(neighbour)

# --- main ---
graph = {}
n = int(input("Enter number of vertices: "))
for i in range(n):
    v = input(f"Enter vertex {i+1}: ")
    graph[v] = []

e = int(input("Enter number of edges: "))
for i in range(e):
    u, v = input(f"Enter edge {i+1} (u v): ").split()
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)  # undirected
start = input("Enter starting vertex: ")
print("\nDFS Traversal:")
dfs(graph, start, set())
print("\nBFS Traversal:")
bfs(graph, start)
